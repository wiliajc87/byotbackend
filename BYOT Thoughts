NOTES FOR THESE RULES
Participants--After 6 shows, consecutively, they lose status if they had it
  At 5 missed shows, they need a warning.
When someone is at 5 shows, alert staff about potential new members
  Participants need a Lost? attribute for losing status because they can regain some show counts.
